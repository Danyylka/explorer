# Verification

Modular Cloud enables rollups and their users to verify contracts across the modular ecosystem with both a simple web UI or a suite of API endpoints. 

---

## Using Web UI

In lieu of accessing the API directly, you can quickly [verify contracts from this web page](https://contract-verification.vercel.app/).

1. Click to browse your File Explorer for the .sol contract file and .json metadata file for upload.
2. Paste the contract address you'd like to verify.
3. Select the chain on which the contract is located.
4. Click the Verify button.
5. Wait for the interface to present a pop-up response with feedback.
