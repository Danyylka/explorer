# Metrics

**This preview API is subject to change.**

Measure what matters. Since your chain's usage matters, you may want to monitor its key metrics. Our API allows you to do just that. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The metrics response

Our metrics API returns the following data points, with variations based whether a chain use the EVM and SVM (Solana). Currently, Cosmos chains are not supported.

### Metrics properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="CONTRACT" type="number">
    For EVM chains, this is the number of unique contracts that have been deployed, excluding predeployed contracts and contracts deployed by internal transactions. For SVM chains, this is the number of unique programs that have been interacted with (including inner instructions).
  </Property>
  <Property name="TRANSACTION" type="number">
    The number of unique transactions processed by the chain. This does not include internal transactions on the EVM.
  </Property>
  <Property name="UNIQUE_ADDRESS" type="number">
    For EVM chains, this is the number of unique addresses included in the `to` and `from` fields of a transaction. For SVM chains, this is the number of account keys that have appeared in the transaction messages on-chain.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Other fields

<Properties>
  <Property name="blockNumber | slotNumber" type="string">
    The latest block or slot number, for EVM and SVM chains respectively, at which the metrics were recorded.
  </Property>
</Properties>
